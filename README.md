# Why Does This Exist?
This repository exists for people to request features missing from Athena which are either present in other bots or that no other bot has.

# How Do I Request A Feature?
Open an Issue or Email me at `darknessdevplugins@gmail.com`

# How Do I Know If My Feature Request Was Accepted?
If you open an issue, I or an admin will reply telling you that this feature request is accepted. If you emailed me instead, I will reply to that email.

# OK, What Feature Requests Have Already Been Accepted?
### Here is a list of planned features based on this repository:
<ul>

    None yet! Got a feature you want? Open an Issue!

</ul>
